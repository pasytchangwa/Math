# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Math Magician Project: Full Website with React

"Math magicians" is a website for all fans of mathematics. It is a Single Page App (SPA) that allows users to:

- Make simple calculations.
- Read a random math-related quote.

The aim of this project is to learn how to use React.

## Built With

This project is build with:

- HTML;
- CSS;
- JavaScript, ReactJs.

## Cloning the project

To get the content of this project locally you need to run this command in your terminal:

- `git clone git@github.com:pasytchangwa/Math.git`
- `cd Math`
- Use `npm start` to run the app in live server

## Linters

For tracking linter errors locally you need to follow these steps:

- After cloning the project you need to run this command

  > `npm install`
  > This command will download all the dependancies of the project

- For tracking the linter errors in HTML file run:

  > `npx hint .`

- For tracking the linter errors in CSS file run:

  > `npx stylelint "\*_/_.{css,scss}"`

- And For tracking the linter errors in JavaScript file run:

  > `npx eslint .`

- Use `npm run build` to run the app in live server

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test/npm run test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
